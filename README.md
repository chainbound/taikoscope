# Taikoscope ðŸ”­

Taikoscope is a realâ€‘time monitoring and analytics system for the Taiko
blockchain. It continuously ingests events from Ethereum (L1) and Taiko (L2),
persists timeâ€‘series metrics in ClickHouse and exposes them via a REST API and a
React dashboard.

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (2024 edition)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- A running ClickHouse instance
- Access to L1 and L2 RPC endpoints
- Node.js (for the dashboard)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Run `just install-dashboard` to fetch dashboard packages.
3. Copy `dev.env` and adjust the values for your setup or provide your own env
   file via the `ENV_FILE` variable.
4. (Optional) Start ClickHouse and the dashboard via Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

5. Start the extractor and API server:

   ```bash
   just dev         # runs the extractor/driver
   just dev-api     # runs the HTTP API
   ```

6. Start the dashboard (optional if not using Docker Compose):

   ```bash
   just dev-dashboard
   ```

The API is now available on `http://localhost:3000` and the dashboard on
`http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Environment

All configuration is provided via environment variables. The most relevant
variables are shown below. See [`crates/config`](crates/config) for the full
list.

```text
CLICKHOUSE_URL=<http://localhost:8123>
CLICKHOUSE_DB=taikoscope
L1_RPC_URL=<l1-endpoint>
L2_RPC_URL=<l2-endpoint>
PUBLIC_RPC=<hekla-endpoint>
TAIKO_INBOX_ADDRESS=<0x...>
TAIKO_PRECONF_WHITELIST_ADDRESS=<0x...>
TAIKO_WRAPPER_ADDRESS=<0x...>
API_HOST=127.0.0.1
API_PORT=3000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=1000
RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD_SECS=60
INSTATUS_HEKLA_RPC_COMPONENT_ID=<component>
```

These variables map to the configuration structs defined in
[`crates/config`](crates/config) (`ClickhouseOpts`, `RpcOpts`,
`TaikoAddressOpts`, `ApiOpts` and `InstatusOpts`).

## Architecture

Taikoscope follows a layered architecture that keeps data ingestion and
presentation concerns separate:

1. **Driver and Extractor** â€“ subscribe to L1 and L2 chains, process events
   such as block headers and batch submissions, and write them to ClickHouse
   via the `ClickhouseWriter`.
2. **Storage** â€“ a ClickHouse database holds tables like
   `l1_head_events`, `l2_head_events`, `batches` and `proved_batches`. Reads and
   writes use dedicated reader and writer clients.
3. **API Server** â€“ an Axum based service exposing 20+ REST endpoints and
   Serverâ€‘Sent Events. `ApiState` manages database access and IP based rate
   limiting.
4. **Dashboard** â€“ a React application that fetches metrics using the API
   service layer and renders them with lazy loaded charts.
5. **Monitoring** â€“ background monitors trigger incidents via Instatus when
   thresholds are exceeded. This includes polling the public RPC endpoint to
   ensure it is fully synced.

Events flow through the system continuously. The driver handles header and
batch streams, inserts rows into ClickHouse and the API aggregates this data for
the dashboard. The UI now polls the API periodically to update metrics.

## Development

Formatting, linting and tests can be run via `just`:

```bash
just fmt      # format the code
just lint     # run clippy
just lint-dashboard # check dashboard whitespace
just test     # run the test suite
just ci       # runs fmt, lint, lint-dashboard and test
```

## Deployment

Deployment scripts use `ssh` and `docker` to build the images remotely.
Create an entry in your `~/.ssh/config` (for example named `taiko`) and then run:

```bash
just deploy-remote-hekla        # deploy the extractor/driver
just deploy-api-remote-hekla    # deploy the API server
```
